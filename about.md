Hey there! Thanks for visiting my site! My name is Alejandro Isa, everyone knows me by Alex. After graduating high school from Markham College in Lima, Peru, I travelled to Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, to pursue a **BSc. in Computer Science** at Memorial University of Newfoundland.

During my time at university, I gained valuable experience in technical support and customer service at The Commons, located inside the Queen Elizabeth II Library at Memorial University.

As a hobby, I enjoy learning about photography and visual design, focusing on user interaction and aesthetic design production.

*Thank You for reading!*
