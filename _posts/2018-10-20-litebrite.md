Starting to learn about JavaScript and JQuery, I stumbled upon this fun project on Codecademy. The goal is to create a LiteBrite application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery. 

This application can be scaled to add more rows (I actually removed some for the sake of this demo) and add more colours as well in a very simple manner.

Play with this app [here!](https://aisaadaniya.github.io/litebrite/index.html)
